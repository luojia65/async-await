## Notes

This class currently doesn't have a lot of speakers notes but for context we wanted to teach a few
things when giving this class:

1. What is a Future? We accomplish this by hand writing one to understand it's a state machine
2. How does this fit into the overall execution model
3. What is the execution model?

We wanted to show that the higher level things people will work with normally are great and for the
*most* part you won't need to touch a lot of the primitives. However, we wanted to give a deep dive
so that you can appreciate the higher level abstractions.
